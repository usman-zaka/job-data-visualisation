# Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power BI
## Introduction
This dashboard was created for Job Seekers, Job Transitioners, and Job Swappers to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings (including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compensation.

### Dashboard File
You can find the file for the dashboard here: ```[Data_Jobs_Dashboard.pbix](https://github.com/usman-zaka/job-data-visualisation/blob/main/Data_Jobs_Dashboard.pbix)```
